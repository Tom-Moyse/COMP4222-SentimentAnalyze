Project Overview
The focus of the project and code is to predict/classify nodes in a graph as either 'republican' or 'democratic'

The graph itself was constructed from new york times article keywords (over 3 months preceding 2020 election):
	Nodes represent a given keyword
	Edges represent two keywords being present in the same article
Many of the keywords refer to American politicians who were then labelled by cross-referencing a goverment database

Two methods were attempted to classify graph nodes in a semi-supervised manner: GraphSAGE and a harmonic function
This had the aim of not just classifying politicians but other keywords as well to investigate interesting relationships

Code Overview
Two notebooks have been submitted:
	get_nyt_data contains the code used for pulling keywords and politician labels as well as constructing the adjacency matrix and node dataframe
	COMP4222 contains the code for the two approaches described above and makes use of data generated from first notebook

Note: The graph data generated from the first notebook is quite large (approx. 2gb) so has not been included in this upload
